Overview
--------

This repository houses the analytical pipeline to support the project, *Defining foraging hotspots of finfish and sharks in the New York Bight: Linking trophic dynamics with spatiotemporal trends in species distributions*. 

### Purpose

This pipeline is used to summarise data of trawl species data, pull environmental forecasts and backcasts of regional environmental variables, fit species and community models of the biological community, and forecast species biomasses/abundance to predict future sampling. The general structure of the pipeline is shown below.

```{r pipeline-fig, out.width = '70%', fig.cap = "General schematic of the analytical pipeline to predict species biomasses.", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(path = here("docs/model-pres_June2025.png"))
```

### Repository structure

The repository is structured to keep the workflow organized. To do so, it uses the ['here' package](https://here.r-lib.org/) to navigate the file structure across users. The package can be installed from CRAN using `install.pacakges('here')`.

The main repository structure contains the folders:

- code: This contains all the scripts to load and clean the biological and environmental data.

Within this folder the `init.R` script contains the important standardized, study-level variables that should be used for initial project setup and data downloads. This script loads all required packages, internal functions and options, and repository checks to correctly setup the repository across users.

- data: This folder holds derived data output from functions. The raw trawl data is stored on a local Access database named, `Nearshore Survey.accdb`. This file must be placed in a local folder in the project root directory called, `ignore`. The `ignore` folder should be added to the `.gitignore` file to avoid corrupting the database during Git procedures. The `init.R` file contains a procedure to check that the file structure is correct.

- docs: This folder houses project documents and output reports to summarise models and forecasts

- ignore: This is a hidden local folder that houses the Access database. This should be included in the local project `.gitignore` so must be created by each user. See above for initiation checks in the `init.R` script.

### Database access

Once the database is correctly stored locally, access to the database is managed by the [RODBC package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html). This can be downloaded from CRAN using `install.packages("RODBC")`. 

The connection to the database is set using

```{r db-conn, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
conn <- odbcConnectAccess2007(here("ignore/Nearshore Survey.accdb"))
```

and all the available database tables with

```{r db-tables, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sqlTables(conn)
```

```{r db-tables-view, echo=FALSE}
head(sqlTables(conn),5) %>% dplyr::select(TABLE_NAME, TABLE_TYPE)
```

### Environmental variables from the Copernicus Marine Service

Hindcasts and forecasts of environmental variables such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chla) are sourced from [Copernicus Marine Service](https://marine.copernicus.eu/). Updated products are accessed through the Copernicus API. To do so, you must [register a free Copernicus account](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/register). 

Accessing the Copernicus API is operated with the [`copernicusR` package](https://github.com/HansTtito/copernicusR). To install the package:

```{r copernicusR-install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Install if you don't have remotes
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install copernicusR
remotes::install_github("HansTtito/copernicusR")

# Load the package
library(copernicusR)
```

Follow the instructions on the [`copernicusR` page](https://github.com/HansTtito/copernicusR) to set up the credentials of your Copernicus account. It is recommended to follow the "Alternative Setup: Method 3" instructions to securely set environmental variables for your account username and password.

#### Initial download

The Copernicus systems provide a number of different environmental data products that vary in the spatial and temporal extents. Initial data downloads of hindcast data were completed for the study area in the following coordinates:

```{r nys-coords, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
NYSbbox = c(-74.262999, -71.389711, 39.803091, 41.431287)
```

This should be used for all data downloads of regional environmental data.

Sea surface temperature data is provided in two different products, one prior to 2022-06-01 (Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis: GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030), and the current forecast out 1-week from current (Global Ocean Physics Analysis and Forecast: GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024). These were initially combined by downloading and summarising the data for the study area:

This data currently covers 1-month past the final trawl data of 2024-08-14 (i.e., 2024-09-14). For the purposes of this initial exercise, we would treat this next month for forecasting purposes.

  dplyr::mutate(future = ifelse(as.Date(date) <= as.Date("2024-08-14"), FALSE, TRUE))
